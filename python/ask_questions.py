    Answers a question based on the embeddings and knowledge graph created from the
    Obsidian vault.

    This pulls in information from both the embeddings and the knowledge graph:

    For the embeddings:
    - Uses GPT to convert the question into a declarative statement
    - Creates embeddings from the declarative statement
    - Does a search of the vector store and grabs the most relevant document chunk IDs
      by cosine similarity

    For the knowledge graph:
    - Uses GPT to identify which nodes in the graph are most relevant to the question
    - Collects the relationships between these nodes in the graph and has GPT summarize
      these relationships
    - Collects the IDs of the document chunks that reference the most relevant nodes

    Together:
    - Combines the collected document chunk IDs from the embeddings and knowledge graph,
      and queries the vector store to collect the associated document chunks
    - Sends GPT a prompt containing the relationship summaries and the retrieved
      document chunks, alongside the user's original question.
