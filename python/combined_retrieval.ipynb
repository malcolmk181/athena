Troy holds strategic importance at the mouth of a water trade route. Additionally, fueled by the success of Troy, Schliemann also discovered Mycenae, known for its burial sites and the palace of Agamemnon. Mycenae was significant for its immense wealth and its role in the Bronze Age trade network.'"
