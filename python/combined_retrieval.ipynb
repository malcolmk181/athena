       "\"Heinrich Schliemann made two major archaeological discoveries:\\n\\n1. **Troy**: Schliemann discovered the ancient city of Troy in the 1870s. His work confirmed that Troy was a real place, which until then was known mainly from Homer's epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey. The city was found to have undergone several rebuildings over time and was located at a strategic position at the mouth of a water trade route.\\n\\n2. **Mycenae**: After his success at Troy, Schliemann went on to uncover the ancient burial sites and the palace of Agamemnon at Mycenae. This discovery was made in 1876 and was significant for the field of archaeology and our understanding of ancient civilizations. Mycenae was a massive Bronze Age walled city with habitation dating back to Neolithic times. Schliemann's excavation revealed immense wealth, including gold, which indicated that the Mycenaeans had engaged in extensive trade or warfare, as gold was not native to Greece.\""
